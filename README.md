> [!NOTE] Proof of concept code testing out a cloud-oriented programming language leveraging Wing.

> Wing aims to enhance the developer experience by treating the entire cloud as its target computer, bringing the benefits of compilers that handle lower stack levels to cloud development. This approach enables developers to focus on creating user value, enjoy greater independence, and experience instant feedback with faster iteration cycles, making cloud application development more enjoyable and efficient.
